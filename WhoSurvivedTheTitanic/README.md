# Who Survived the Sinking of the Titanic?

Hello, World!

This is the joint-second project I am working on as part of my online portfolio to showcase my skills as a Data Scientist, as of 2018-03-01 it is still an ongoing venture. This project aims to delve much deeper into the world of machine learning and apply it to the question: Who survived the sinking of the Titanic? This project is a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

All the best,    
Matthew
