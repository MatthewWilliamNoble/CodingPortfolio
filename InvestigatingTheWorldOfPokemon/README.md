# InvestigatingTheWorldOfPokémon    

This project was my first. The report documents collecting and wrangling the data, analysing and visualising it, and finally testing machine-learning algorithms in order to predict if a Pokémon is legendary or not, amoungst others?

The Python files used to perform the investigation are also included for download.
