# Investigating the World of Pokémon    

Hello, World!

This project was my first. Its intention was to allow me to demonstrate my skill-set as a Data Scientist to a fun topic I know inside and out: Pokémon. The project showcases the skills of:    
    
*  Importing and cleaning data in Python.
*  Manipulating and merging DataFrames with pandas.
*  Analysing and visualising data with matplotlib.
*  Machine-learning with SciKit-Learn.    
*  Report writing.    

The Python files used to perform the investigation and generate the plots are included for download in the "PythonCodes" folder.    

The next two projects I will undertake seek to demonstrate more heavily machine-learning applications and applied probability and statistics. These two projects are [WhoSurvivedTheTitanic](https://github.com/MatthewWilliamNoble/CodingPortfolio/tree/master/WhoSurvivedTheTitanic) and [LetsPlayAGame](https://github.com/MatthewWilliamNoble/CodingPortfolio/tree/master/LetsPlayAGame) respectively.

All the best,     
Matthew
