## Description 

These files provide detailed road safety data about the circumstances of personal injury road accidents in GB, the types (including Make and Model) of vehicles involved and the consequential casualties. The statistics relate only to personal injury accidents on public roads that are reported to the police, and subsequently recorded, using the STATS19 accident reporting form. 

## Task 

The purpose of this analysis is:

* To summarize the main characteristics of the data, and obtain interesting facts that are worth highlighting.

* Identity and quantify associations (if any) between the number of causalities (in the Accidents table) and other variables in the data set.

* Explore whether it is possible to predict accident hotspots based on the data. 

Your data analysis should consist of the following components:

1. A sort description and justification of the steps taken.

2. Visualization and description of the data.

3. Performance and evaluations results of the predictive model.

4. Insights gained from the analysis. 

Please send a copy of your completed analysis to HR within a week (7 days).
