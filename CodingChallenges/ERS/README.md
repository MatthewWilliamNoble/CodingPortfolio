## The Brief

Evaluate the relative risk of a number of regions. Use the provided vehicle risk data with a selection of area related features attached to evaluate the relative risk of each region. You must assign a rating (1-99, low to high) for each region that is representative of its relative risk.

The dataset comprises of 32 columns, including 28 of area-related features that you may use to analyse relative area risk.

You may analyse the data any way you like. However, assessment will consider both the technical quality of your work and your ability to present the results. You can assume you will be presenting to an audience familiar with statistical methods and the insurance context (senior actuary or senior underwriter). You should be prepared to answer technical questions on the methods that you have elected to use.

Please annotate your code/analysis and ensure that your presentation includes the following:

  1. Brief commentary on rationale for the method(s) employed 

  2. Analysis of strengths and weaknesses of your approach 

  3. Brief description of any evaluation metric(s) that you used

## What to Submit

Candidates must submit three exhibits:

  1. **Short presentation**, (15 min) which you will present as part of the assessment. You should be prepared to explain and defend your work during a 15 min Q&A session following the presentation. Please provide as either PowerPoint/pdf/RMarkDown/html etc. 

  2. **CSV file with each of the regions and resulting 1-99 scores**. Please give the regions a rating between 1 and 99 related to their predicted risk level (with 99 being the highest risk regions). We have supplied a template for the submission exhibit. 

  3. **Supporting information, ideally as a single zip file**. Please provide sufficient code, model files and/or documentation of your analysis in a legible format (html, pynb, R, excel etc.) so that your work could be repeated by an appropriately trained analyst. Please ensure that any accompanying visualisations and annotations render correctly and can be viewed after emailing.
