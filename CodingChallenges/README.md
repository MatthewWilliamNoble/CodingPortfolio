# Coding Challenges

## Preamble

Hello, World! The following directory was created to house all of the coding challenges that I have undertaken whilst job hunting. As always, if you have any constructive criticism to allow me to get better as both a programmer and data scientist, please don't hesitate to contact me.

#### The brief

Evaluate the relative risk of a number of regions. Use the provided vehicle risk data with a selection of area related features attached to evaluate the relative risk of each region. You must assign a rating (1-99, low to high) for each region that is representative of its relative risk.

The dataset comprises of 32 columns, including 28 of area-related features that you may use to analyse relative area risk.

You may analyse the data any way you like. However, assessment will consider both the technical quality of your work and your ability to present the results. You can assume you will be presenting to an audience familiar with statistical methods and the insurance context (senior actuary or senior underwriter). You should be prepared to answer technical questions on the methods that you have elected to use.

Please annotate your code/analysis and ensure that your presentation includes the following:

  1.	Brief commentary on rationale for the method(s) employed 

  2.	Analysis of strengths and weaknesses of your approach 

  3.	Brief description of any evaluation metric(s) that you used
