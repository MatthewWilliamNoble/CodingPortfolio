# Lets Play a Game ... of Chance!

Hello, World!

This is the joint-second project I am working on as part of my online portfolio to showcase my skills as a Data Scientist, as of 2018-03-01 it is still an ongoing venture. This project aims to delve much deeper into the areas of probability and statistics and apply them to a dice game.

Regards,     
Matthew
