# ProjectEuler

[ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) is a phenomenal resource to practice quantitative computer questions and in answering those questions, learn algorithms, memory management, and simply the ins and outs of a particular language.

This folder will house the questions and answers, and code used to the first 50 questions in Python. I have left it there for 2 reasons, 1) they have served their purpose of teaching me how to code in Python and break down the problem into logical tasks, and 2) I have moved on to taking part in HackerEarth, HackerRank, and Kaggle challenges. I may revisit these problems in the future with a new language, perhaps R or C? Until then - Goodbye, World!
