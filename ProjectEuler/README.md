# [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives)

Hello, World! Project Euler, in its own words:

> A website dedicated to the fascinating world of mathematics and programming.

It is a phenomenal resource to practice quantitative questions, and in answering those questions, learn algorithms, memory management, and simply the ins and outs of a particular language.

This folder will house my coded solutions. 

All the best,     
Matthew
